<h1>The Fantastic Tales of Mr. Peanut</h1>
<hr>
<p>There once was a little peanut named Johnny. Johnny was a brave, courageous peanut but unfortunately he suffered from anxiety and panic attacks. One day when Johnny was walking home he heard screaming. Johnny ran towards the screaming and saw it was coming from a house that was on fire. Without batting an eye Johnny dashed into the house to save the person he had heard screaming. Johnny found the person and managed to save both them and himself. The town saw Johnny's brave deeds and decided to award him with a bravery medal. Johnny was so ecstatic he started crying.
