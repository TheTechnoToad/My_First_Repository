      <p style= "font-size: 1.5em">Here at Squakka's Googly Eye Emporium we have the utmost respect for all  things googly eye. When our founder Senor Squakka came across his first googly eye he was enamored. Ever since then he has done everything he can to not only integrate googly eyes into our society but to ensure that no-one who needs a googly eye will go without. 
      Senor Squakka sold his first googly eye on January 2, 2017. He recalls it as one of the most fullfilling moments of his life. The following day he sold over 10 more. He then decided to create "Squakka's Googly Eye Emporium", and the rest is history. <br>
      Fun Fact: Senor Squakka's favorite use of googly eyes is on common household items such as doorknobs.
